## Also I should mention

- **OTD** for 356 Mini. Origin of O-ring gasket mount style

- **overset** for [JP01](https://github.com/overset/JP01). The idea of publishing the case design on Onshape. After seeing their great work I switched from fusion360 to Onshape
- **Rhuk** gave me a lot of advice on keyboard design and manufacturing
- **Maker Keyboards** suggested adding a plate cutout to remove the PCB using a keycap puller
- And many community members for giving me advice and feedback, thanks!
